# Smart Waste Management System

Welcome to the Smart Waste Management System project.

## Project Overview
The project aims to enhance the efficiency of waste collection, reduce operational costs, and promote environmental sustainability by implementing an IoT-based smart waste management system.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Uses ultrasonic sensors to monitor waste bin fill levels.
- **Automatic Status Updates:** Provides real-time status updates on a digital map.
- **Optimized Collection Routes:** Designs efficient waste collection routes based on collected data.
- **Data Analytics:** Analyzes data to predict future waste levels and optimize collection schedules.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Displays real-time data and suggested collection routes for waste collection personnel.

## Technologies Used
- **Hardware:** ESP32 microcontrollers, ultrasonic sensors, LoRa communication modules.
- **Software:** MQTT protocol, HiveMQ Cloud, Amazon SageMaker, Google Colab.
- **Cloud Infrastructure:** InfluxDB for data storage, machine learning models for analytics.
